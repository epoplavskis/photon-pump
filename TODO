0.5 Todo

* Decide on an approach for retrying connections; may defer to 0.6
* Implement remaining tests
* Move binary-dump level messages to TRACE

0.6 Todo

* Strict type checking for messages.py
* Timeout and retry for message responses.
* Clean shutdown
* Extract polymorphic Reply types and kill handle_reply

0.7 Todo
